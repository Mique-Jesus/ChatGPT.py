***Guidelines to use ChatGPT with Python***

ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. As a developer, you can leverage ChatGPT's capabilities to build various language-related applications and integrate natural language understanding and generation into your projects.

To get started taking advantage of this new technology, we reviewed the "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" course by OpenAI and compiled the topics addressed.
