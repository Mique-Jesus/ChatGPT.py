***Guidelines to use ChatGPT with Python***

ChatGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI and based on the GPT-3.5 architecture. It is a cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) model designed to understand and generate human-like text based on the input it receives. As a developer, you can leverage ChatGPT's capabilities to build various language-related applications and integrate natural language understanding and generation into your projects.

To get started taking advantage of this new technology, we reviewed the "ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers" course by OpenAI and compiled the topics addressed.

Here are some of the specific things you will learn in this guideline:

-How to use the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT \
-How to write prompts that are specific, informative, and engaging \
-How to use keywords and entities to improve the accuracy of your prompts \
-How to use context to improve the fluency of your prompts \
-How to iterate on your prompts to get the best results
